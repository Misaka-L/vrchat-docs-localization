# New Worlds and Avatars in 2022

Looking to make a new project in Unity 2022? Luckily it's pretty easy: The Creator Companion will handle most of the work for you!

### Download the Creator Companion
**If you don't already have the VCC**, you'll need to download it! 

Follow the steps on our [Getting Started](/creators.vrchat.com/sdk/) page.

This is the easiest way to create a new project with the correct Unity version. The Creator Companion will automatically install Unity 2022.3.6, the world SDK, and the avatar SDK for you.

**If you already have the VCC**, [make sure it's updated and upgraded to Unity 2022](unity-2022.md#using-the-creator-companion), and you're [launching all new projects in Unity 2022](unity-2022.md#managing-unity-versions).
